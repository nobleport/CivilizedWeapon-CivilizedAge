Welcome to my Elegant Weapon, Civilized Age project!

I wanted to create a project that is a reflection of who I am and what makes me tick. The purpose of this project is to create a workstation 
where a user (prospective jedi) can create their own, unique, digital prototype of a lightsaber. The user will have access to a terminal
which gives them information about the three core pieces of their lightsaber. They will be able to choose these pieces, which will automatically be added to their prototype. When they are done, they will be able to click anywhere on the lightsaber to turn it on.

In Elegant Weapon, Civilized Age, a user can:
 - Select a crystal, a sleeve, and an emitter. 
 - Ignite a blade (the colorful part) which is made entirely using css styling. Based on the crystal chosen, the ignited blade chnges color.
